        Web development is an evolving amalgamation of languages that work in
        concert to receive, modify, and deliver information between parties
        using the Internet as a mechanism of delivery. While it is easy to
        describe conceptually, implementation is accompanied by an overwhelming
        variety of languages, platforms, templates, frameworks, guidelines, and
        standards. Navigating a project from concept to completion often
        requires more than mastery of one or two complementing languages,
        meaning today’s developers need both breadth, and depth, of knowledge to
        be effective. This text provides the developer with an understanding of
        the various elements of web development by focusing on the concepts and
        fundamentals through the examples within, providing a foundation that
        allows easier transition to other languages and a better understanding
        of how to approach their work. The reader will be introduced to topics
        in a manner that follows most project development methods, from initial
        conceptualization and design through front end development, back end
        development, and introducing additional concepts like accessibility and
        security, while focusing on responsive design techniques. Each section
        of the text includes opportunities to practice the material and assess
        increased knowledge after examining the topics. “While most web
        development texts opt to delve deeply into one or two of the tools in
        the belt of a web programmer, the author of this text takes a broad
        approach to teaching web programming and development. The result is a
        single resource that integrates good design practices, modern
        technologies, and all of the programming tools that one would need to
        build a successful, dynamic web site.” – Robert Olsen, SUNY Fredonia
